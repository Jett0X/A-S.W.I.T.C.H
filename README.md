## - Automated Smart Wattage Intervention And Transition For Cost-Effective Handling Of Electricity 

<h4>
The research study, entitled "A-S.W.I.T.C.H: Automated Smart Wattage Intervention and Transition for Cost Effective Handling of Electricity" is motivated by two paramount issues: the threat of house fires and the pervasive problem of excessive energy consumption. To address these concerns, this study was conducted. The device is designedto exhibit resilience and adaptability under various environmental conditions, not onlyfunctions reliably at different air temperatures, accommodating fluctuations that occurthroughout the day but also exhibits impressive performance across diverse atmosphericconditions. The Ultrasonic Sensor was connected to different pins and LED triggers. The dewas tested at different time of the day at varying air temperature. It was also tested at different atmospheric conditions specifically, on a sunny and a rainy day. Moreover, the accuracy of the device was alsotested at different distances namely, 2 cm, 201 cm, and 400 cm. Lastly, to test the efficiency of the device, we tested the appliances particularly the Light bulb and Electricfan connected to the power supply if the current is totally cut off. The system has versatileability to detect humans at varying distances, spanning from its minimum detection rangeto its maximum capability. In summary, the study's ability to address the pressing concernsof house fires and excessive energy consumption underscores its significance. The positiveresults obtained across at different conditions indicate its potential to revolutionize safety and energy efficiency in various settings, presenting a more secure and sustainable.
